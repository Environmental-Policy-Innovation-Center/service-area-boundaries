# downloaders
These downloader files are intended to be helpers for downloading data pertinent to EPIC's drinking water service area boundaries work. These downloaders can be copy and pasted into other code to prevent the need for saving individual files in the repository.
For example, the sdwis_api downloader shows how to simply download data for all active community water systems and should be used in other code to improve its reproducibility.
