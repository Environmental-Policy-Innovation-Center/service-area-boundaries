# Drinking Water Utility Service Area Boundaries
A repository for storage and collaboration of EPIC's work on drinking water service area boundaries - the website for this work can be found [here](https://www.policyinnovation.org/technology/water-utility-service-area-boundaries). From Justice40 tracking and drought planning to answering the question of, “is my water safe to drink?” - this data can help to improve the design and implementation of water and climate programs at the federal, state, and community level. 

There are three main data components to this project:
- Advising on how to use this data to advance drinking water justice through data analysis and screening tools
- Collating and validating service area boundaries data, especially for historially marginalized communities
- Making it easier to update and add boundaries to the dataset - a prototype for that work can be found [here](https://gis.cgs.earth/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b45923f23d7b491680683df590336612)
